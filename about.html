                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I have completed a Computer Science degree at the University of Connecticut, with a concentration in Machine Learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past few years, I have learned and applied various new coding concepts and languages to classes and projects, and have had a software engineering internship at General Dynamics Electric Boat, where I improved my coding skills and gained experience in the workforce. Throughout this time, my passion for coding has only increased as I realize how all the concepts intertwine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I would like to apply my skills in careers related to software development, embedded software development, CV, AI, or ML. Preferably I will have the chance to work with GUIs. I also have a particular interest in wearable technologies and the human-computer interactions that go with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently looking for jobs to do after my summer internship at United Health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I like to play badminton with friends in Connecticut, as well as travel to New York.
